# S3 Bucket Creation
Ask me about anything that you are not sure of.

## Initial Setup of S3 Bucket
Generate Terraform using opentofu version 6.0 and save all the files in the folder named "terraform".
I want the bucket name to be "jeff-meta-poc" and set the region to "us-west-2". I want versioning turned on for the bucket.
The access to the bucket needs to be open for a web application to do CRUD on the item being uploaded to the bucket.
I want the bucket to have metadata configurations turned on and enable the inventory_table_configuration and journal_table_configuration with expiration set to 7 days.
Set the CORS for the bucket to the following origins:
- http://localhost:5173
- https://s3upload.d1cusxywbulok7.amplifyapp.com

## Set up AWS Glue
Set up an AWS Glue Database for S3 Bucket Inventory bucket metadata table.
Set up an AWS Glue Crawler to crawl the S3 bucket's inventory_table_configuration and populate the AWS Glue Table with metadata information, specifically the user_metadata field.

## Set up Athena
Set up Athena to query the AWS Glue Table and retrieve metadata information from the S3 bucket.
