# S3 Bucket Creation

## Initial Setup of S3 Bucket
Ask me about anything that you are not sure of.

Generate Terraform using opentofu version 6.0 and save all the files in the folder named "terraform".
I want the bucket name to be "jeff-meta-poc" and set the region to "us-west-2". I want versioning turned on for the bucket.
I want to set up an IAM role for the bucket to allow access to the bucket. I will want to know the IAM Access Key Id and the IAM Secret Access Key.
The access to the bucket needs to be open for a web application to do CRUD on the item being uploaded to the bucket.
Set the CORS for the bucket to the following origins:
- http://localhost:5173
- http://localhost:4173
- http://localhost:3000
- https://s3upload.d1cusxywbulok7.amplifyapp.com
